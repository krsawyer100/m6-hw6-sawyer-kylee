                        Hello! I’m a recent Summa Cum Laude graduate with a Bachelor's in Design Studies from North Carolina State University. I’m really excited to dive headfirst into the world of UX Design and see how it can truly transform things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my undergraduate studies, I developed a deep appreciation for how design shapes peoples lives and the world around us. Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in the world of design history, theory, and methods which has provided me with the abilities to break down and critical analyze various design approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When pursuing my Design Studies degree, I became fascinated with design research, especially during my senior year when developing my capstone research project where I focused on ADHD-friendly design of physical environments. It was incredible to explore this topic in great detail, challenge assumptions, and come up with a design solution based upon that research. Design that is grounded in thorough research has the potential to guide designers when tackling even the trickiest problems and promotes thoughtful change. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, as I continue with my studies as a Web Design graduate student through the University of Florida, I look forward to taking my new knowledge about digital design and combine it with my knowledge of design research. Blending the artistic and research sides of design will a lot for me as a designer to create digital solutions that meet the needs and wants of users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though I’m new to the professional world of design, I am very passionate about UX design and design research. I’m determined to connect the dots between my academic teachings and real-world applications. I have a deep curiosity for understanding why users do what they do, their pain points, and how design can be user-friendly and accommodating. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I'm looking to help teams with other researchers and designers refine their user experience. I'm really excited to learn from their experiences and bring my new outlook to projects that need some insight from a different perspective. Let's connect and dive into the exciting world of UX design together!
